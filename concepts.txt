A stateless app :
	-	is an application program that does not save client data generated in one 
		session for use in the next session with that client. Each session is carried 
		out as if it was the first time and responses are not dependent upon data from 
		a previous session.

user agent :
	-	refers to any of the various client programs that initiate a request, 
		including (but not limited to) browsers, spiders (web-based robots), command-line 
		tools, custom applications, and mobile apps.


Three-tier architecture : application architecture that organizes applications into three logical and physical computing tiers:
	-	the presentation tier, or user interface; 
	-	the application tier, where data is processed; 
	-	and the data tier, where the data associated with the application is stored and managed.

	-	scheme : protocol
	-	authority : userInfo + host + port
	-	path
