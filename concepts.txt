Raw Sockets:
	-	used for implementing new transport layer protocols.
	-	sends and receives packets of information without using the computer 
		operating system as a middleman.
	-	reduces cpu overload due to the operating system way of handling data transmission.

Sequenced-packet sockets:
	-	allow the user to manipulate the Sequence Packet Protocol (SPP) or Internet Datagram 
		Protocol (IDP) headers on a packet or a group of packets, either by writing a prototype 
		header along with whatever data is to be sent, or by specifying a default header to be
		used with all outgoing data, and allows the user to receive the headers on incoming packets.


A stateless app :
	-	is an application program that does not save client data generated in one 
		session for use in the next session with that client. Each session is carried 
		out as if it was the first time and responses are not dependent upon data from 
		a previous session.

user agent :
	-	refers to any of the various client programs that initiate a request, 
		including (but not limited to) browsers, spiders (web-based robots), command-line 
		tools, custom applications, and mobile apps.


Out-of-Band Signaling : is any transmission technology in which signaling is separate 
	from the data being transmitted. Out-of-band signaling uses one or more channels for 
	transmitting data or voice information and one special out-of-band channel for 
	performing signaling functions such as establishing and terminating the communication 
	link, controlling flow, or transmitting error information.


Three-tier architecture : application architecture that organizes applications into three logical and physical computing tiers:
	-	the presentation tier, or user interface; 
	-	the application tier, where data is processed; 
	-	and the data tier, where the data associated with the application is stored and managed.



URI : identifies a resource by name, location, or both.
URN : number/name
URL : protocol + number/name. It is made of :
	-	scheme : protocol
	-	authority : userInfo + host + port
	-	path
	-	query
	-	fragment
	--> scheme://userInfo@host:port/path?query#fragment
