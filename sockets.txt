Raw Sockets:
	-	used for implementing new transport layer protocols.
	-	sends and receives packets of information without using the computer 
		operating system as a middleman.
	-	reduces cpu overload due to the operating system way of handling data transmission.

Sequenced-packet sockets:
	-	allow the user to manipulate the Sequence Packet Protocol (SPP) or Internet Datagram 
		Protocol (IDP) headers on a packet or a group of packets, either by writing a prototype 
		header along with whatever data is to be sent, or by specifying a default header to be
		used with all outgoing data, and allows the user to receive the headers on incoming packets.


Out-of-Band Signaling : is any transmission technology in which signaling is separate 
	from the data being transmitted. Out-of-band signaling uses one or more channels for 
	transmitting data or voice information and one special out-of-band channel for 
	performing signaling functions such as establishing and terminating the communication 
	link, controlling flow, or transmitting error information.

-	A SIGPIPE signal is raised if a process sends on a broken stream


-	sockaddr that holds the socket information:
	-	sa_family
	-	sa_data : represented by sockaddr_in in inet_family
