http request:
	-	URL
	-	method type
	-	headers
	-	body


http response:
	-	status code

	-	body



pipelining :
	-	(http 1.1 disabled by default)
	-	a request is sent before the response for the previous request is received.
	-	the responses are then ordered by the client.


http 2:
	multiplexing : shove multiple request in one tcp request
	compression
	secure by default
	protocol negotiation during TLS (NPN/ALPN) to communicate with older protocols (1.0, 1.1)


A stateless app :
	-	is an application program that does not save client data generated in one 
		session for use in the next session with that client. Each session is carried 
		out as if it was the first time and responses are not dependent upon data from 
		a previous session.

user agent :
	-	refers to any of the various client programs that initiate a request, 
		including (but not limited to) browsers, spiders (web-based robots), command-line 
		tools, custom applications, and mobile apps.


Out-of-Band Signaling : is any transmission technology in which signaling is separate 
	from the data being transmitted. Out-of-band signaling uses one or more channels for 
	transmitting data or voice information and one special out-of-band channel for 
	performing signaling functions such as establishing and terminating the communication 
	link, controlling flow, or transmitting error information.
